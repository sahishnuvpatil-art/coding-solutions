# The Painter's Partition Problem-II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  where each element denotes the length of a board, and an integer  **k**  representing the number of  **painters**  available. Each painter takes  **1**  unit of time to paint  **1 unit length**  of a board.

Determine the  **minimum**  amount of time required to paint all the boards, under the constraint that each painter can paint only a  **contiguous**  sequence of boards (no skipping or splitting allowed).

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 35
Explanation: The optimal allocation of boards among 3 painters is - 
Painter 1 → [5, 10] → time = 15
Painter 2 → [30] → time = 30
Painter 3 → [20, 15] → time = 35
Job will be done when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(15, 30, 35) = 35
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: A valid optimal partition is - 
Painter 1 → [10, 20, 30] → time = 60
Painter 2 → [40] → time = 40
Job will be complete at time = max(60, 40) = 60
```

```
Input: arr[] = [100, 200, 300, 400], k = 1
Output: 1000
Explanation: There is only one painter, so the painter must paint all boards sequentially. The total time taken will be the sum of all board lengths, i.e., 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1000.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
1 ≤ k ≤ 105

        int sum=0;

            if(nums[i]>max){
                max=nums[i];
            }
            sum+=nums[i];
        }
        low=max;
        high=sum;

        while(low<high){
            int mid=(low+high)/2;
            int parts=1;
            int currentsum=0;

            for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
                if(currentsum+nums[i]>mid){
                    parts++;
                    currentsum=nums[i];
                }
                else{
                    currentsum+=nums[i];
                }
            }
            if(parts>k){
                low=mid+1;
            }
            else{
                high=mid;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
}
```
