# Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  integer array `nums`. Rearrange the values of `nums` according to the following rules:

- Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order. For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.
- Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order. For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return  *the array formed after rearranging the values of*  `nums`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,1]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
Since there is exactly one odd index and one even index, no rearrangement of values takes place.
The resultant array formed is [2,1], which is the same as the initial array. 

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100

            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                nums[i] = even.get(e++);
            } else {
                nums[i] = odd.get(o++);
            }
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
