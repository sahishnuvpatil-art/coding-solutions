![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string `s`, return the  **maximum**  length of a substring such that it contains  *at most two occurrences*  of each character.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  s = "bcbbbcba"

 **Output:**  4

 **Explanation:** 

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"bcbbbcba"`.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  s = "aaaa"

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"aaaa"`.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= s.length <= 100
- s consists only of lowercase English letters.

        Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        int i = 0, res = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < s.length(); j++) {
            char c = s.charAt(j);
            count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
            while (count.get(c) > 2) {
                char left = s.charAt(i);
                count.put(left, count.get(left) - 1);
                i++;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, j - i + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
