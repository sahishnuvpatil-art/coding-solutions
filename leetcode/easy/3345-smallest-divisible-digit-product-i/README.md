# Smallest Divisible Digit Product I

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given two integers `n` and `t`. Return the  **smallest**  number greater than or equal to `n` such that the  **product of its digits**  is divisible by `t`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  n = 10, t = 2

 **Output:**  10

 **Explanation:** 

The digit product of 10 is 0, which is divisible by 2, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that satisfies the condition.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  n = 15, t = 3

 **Output:**  16

 **Explanation:** 

The digit product of 16 is 6, which is divisible by 3, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that satisfies the condition.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 100
- 1 <= t <= 10

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestNumber(int n, int t) {
        int q = n / 10, r = n % 10;

        int req = t / gcd(q + (10 - q) / 10, t);
        int nxt = ((r + req - 1) / req) * req;
        int x = nxt - (nxt - 10) * (nxt / 10);

        return q * 10 + x;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return (b == 0) ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```
