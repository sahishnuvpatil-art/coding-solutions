# Distinct Subsequences II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Given a string s, return  *the number of  **distinct non-empty subsequences**  of*  `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it  **modulo**  `109 + 7`.

A  **subsequence**  of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 2000
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int distinctSubseqII(String s) {
        int tot = 0;
        int[] dp = new int[26];

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int c = s.charAt(i) - 97;
            int add = (tot - dp[c] + MOD) % MOD;

            dp[c] = 1 + tot;
            tot = (dp[c] + add) % MOD;
        }

        return tot;
    }
}
```
