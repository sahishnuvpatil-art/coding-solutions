# Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

You are given a string `s` and a  **positive**  integer `k`.

Select a set of  **non-overlapping**  substrings from the string `s` that satisfy the following conditions:

- The length of each substring is at least k.
- Each substring is a palindrome.

Return  *the  **maximum**  number of substrings in an optimal selection*.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abaccdbbd", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = "abaccdbbd". Both "aba" and "dbbd" are palindromes and have a length of at least k = 3.
It can be shown that we cannot find a selection with more than two valid substrings.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "adbcda", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the string.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= k <= s.length <= 2000
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPalindromes(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length(), lastEnd = 0, count = 0;

        for (int center = 0; center < 2 * n; center++) {
            int left = center / 2;
            int right = left + center % 2;

            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                if (right - left + 1 >= k) {
                    int end = right + 1;

                    if (left >= lastEnd) {
                        lastEnd = end;
                        count++;
                    } else {
                        lastEnd = Math.min(lastEnd, end);
                    }

                    break;
                }

                left--;
                right++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
