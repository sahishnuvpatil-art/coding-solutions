# Image Overlap

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given two images, `img1` and `img2`, represented as binary, square matrices of size `n x n`. A binary matrix has only `0`s and `1`s as values.

We  **translate**  one image however we choose by sliding all the `1` bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the  **overlap**  by counting the number of positions that have a `1` in  **both**  images.

Note also that a translation does  **not**  include any kind of rotation. Any `1` bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.

Return  *the largest possible overlap*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We translate img1 to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.

The number of positions that have a 1 in both images is 3 (shown in red).

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: img1 = [[1]], img2 = [[1]]
Output: 1

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: img1 = [[0]], img2 = [[0]]
Output: 0

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == img1.length == img1[i].length
- n == img2.length == img2[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 30
- img1[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
- img2[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

        List<int[]> B = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (img1[i][j] == 1) A.add(new int[]{i, j});
                if (img2[i][j] == 1) B.add(new int[]{i, j});
            }
        }
        int[][] cnt = new int[2 * n][2 * n];
        int best = 0;
        for (int[] a : A) {
            for (int[] b : B) {
                int dx = b[0] - a[0] + n;
                int dy = b[1] - a[1] + n;
                best = Math.max(best, ++cnt[dx][dy]);
            }
        }
        return best;
    }
}
