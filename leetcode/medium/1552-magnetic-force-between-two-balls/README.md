# Magnetic Force Between Two Balls

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the  **minimum magnetic force**  between any two balls is  **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return  *the required force*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
Output: 999999999
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == position.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 1 <= position[i] <= 109
- All integers in position are distinct.
- 2 <= m <= position.length

        int ans=0;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
            if(canplace(arr,k,mid)){
                ans=mid;
               low=mid+1;

            }else{
                high=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    private boolean canplace(int []arr,int k , int dist){
        int cows=1;
        int prev=arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]-prev>=dist){
                cows++;
                prev=arr[i];
            }
        }
        if(cows>=k)return true;
        else return false;
    }
}
```
