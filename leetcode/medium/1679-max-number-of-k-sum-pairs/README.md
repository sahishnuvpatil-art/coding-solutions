# Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return  *the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
- 1 <= k <= 109

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        int count = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum == k) {
                count++;
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (sum < k) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
